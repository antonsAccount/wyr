            <p>This project originated from a game I played in real life with my friends. I would just randomily ask silly questions whether my friends would rather do one thing or the other. Sometimes the different options would originate in the situation and sometimes they would be completely unrelated to the context in which we were. Some of the "Would you rather's" were extremely funny, others interesting and many were incredibly stupid (which sometimes made them even more funny) However, what all of them had in common was the basic idea of having a balanced question that is hard to answer for ultimately everyone. The best questions were those were different people in a group answered differently.</p>
